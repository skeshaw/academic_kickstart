I am currently working in the algorithms team of Adobe Advertising Cloud Search (prev. [Adobe Media Optimizer](https://www.adobe.com/advertising/media-optimizer.html)), where I build models which manage ad spends for businesses. I graduated from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in) in the summer of 2017, with a major in Mathematics & Scientific Computing and a minor in Artificial Intelligence.  
I am fascinated by techniques that can help generate information in human languages, to accomplish useful tasks like machine translation and abstractive summarization. In particular, I am intrigued by methods based on the transfer learning paradigm, as I believe they can make up for the paucity of training data in low-resource languages.  
I am an avid football fan and spend most of my weekends watching matches. Sometimes though, I try to brush up my Spanish.
